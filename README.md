## About
Tappy is a collection of quick minigames to have fun when you're bored. It has a tutorial game and 5 minigames that test your reflexes, music and culture knowledge, memory and even strategy. It was our first project in Android + Java development and we explored concepts taught in class as well as expanded our knowledge as well.
